## User Guide

BlizzardBoard is a mobile app that allows you to post bulletins and view posts made by others within the Michigan Tech community.

The app must be run on an Android device or emulator.

### Registration

Once the app is launched, you will be prompted to create a new account. If you already have an account, you may select the appropriate link and log in using your existing credentials.

Registration requires an active email address on the `mtu.edu` domain.

A valid password contains a minimum of six characters, including at least one lower-case letter, one upper-case letter, one number, and one special character (any non-letter/non-number).
